As Soel was made especially for Sakura, Larg was made for Watanuki.<br/><br/>Little is known about Larg, except that it is able to see ghosts, something the White Mokona, Soel, cannot do, and that its main purpose is to stay in contact with Soel, so that Yuuko can know where the group is and assist them if necessary. Also, Black Mokona is used for teleporting things to the White Mokona and vice-versa. It is done by swallowing by one of them and spitting them out by other. Yuuko has also remarked that of the two Mokona, the red earring on the white one possesses the ability to enhance magical power while the blue earring on black one has the ability to seal magical power.<br/><br/>Like Yuuko, Black Mokona loves to drink sake. The name Larg comes from the rune Laguz meaning water. Larg is officially \"male\".<br/><br/>In Horitsuba Gakuen, he is a twin of girl Mokona.",

        "description": "A dragon of heaven, Sorata is an upbeat, irreverent teenager possessing considerable occult abilities, raised by the Shingon Buddhist monks of KÅ�yasan after being taken away from his mother at a young age. A gourmand, he was frequently in trouble at the shrine for stealing food between meals (insisting that he couldn't wait until dinner), and is also a competent cook. It was prophesied that he would protect Kamui with his life, but that he would die for a woman; the first time he meets Arashi, he decides she will be the one. An incessantly friendly young man, he wears down the resistance of both Kamui and Arashi and worms his way into their affections, despite their initial coldness and his own unrefined Kansai dialect.<br/><br/>In addition to generating powerful electrical discharges, he is also capable of calling upon a gohÅ�dÅ�ji, a magical being similar to a shikigami manifesting as a massive, hideous ghostly creature. It is psychically linked to Sorata, allowing him to spy on others and act at a distance from himself, but he suffers any damage inflicted upon it.<br/><br/>In Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle<br/><span class=\"spoiler\"><br/>In the Republic of Hanshin, he&amp;#039;s a cheerful history teacher married to Arashi and is host to Syaoran&amp;#039;s group when they first arrive. In the apocalyptic world Tokyo, he&amp;#039;s one of the seven fighters of the Tower faction.<br/></span><br/>",

He hires Shirou Asou, a bodyguard, to protect her from another kidnapping attempt (she had been kidnapped nine times before). Because her father always pays the ransom, no matter how large, Hina has been kidnapped many times. She later develops deeper feelings towards Shirou.<br/><br/>(Source: Wikipedia)",

His mother, Shashi, at the same time gave birth to Taishakuten's son Ten-Å�, and tried to kill Ashura, whom she believed must stand in her way to rule Heaven at Taishakuten's side. However, Ashura's powers protected him and enclosed him in a cocoon where he slept undisturbed for three hundred years, until Yasha-Å� awoke him.<br/> <br/>Upon being freed from his cocoon, Ashura first appears as a baby, but grows rapidly to a child of maybe eight years. At first outgoing and friendly, he soon becomes aware of his cruel destiny, as Taishakuten has almost everyone with whom he has associated killed. Feeling guilty for their deaths, he vows to become strong enough to defeat Taishakuten himself.<br/><br/><span class=\"spoiler\">However, Ashura has another side: He is, in fact, the \"true Ashura\", the merciless god of war whose wish is the total destruction of Heaven, Earth and Hell. This side was suppressed by several seals, one of which is the distribution of his true power among the Six Stars, but is freed upon their meeting. Only his love for Yasha-Å�, his adoptive father, finally triumphs over his lust for destruction.<br/> <br/>As a punishment for his father's sin, Ashura was born genderless so he cannot continue the royal line of Ashura, which Ashura-Å� so desperately wished to preserve that he tried to defy destiny. Languages which do not have a gender-neutral pronoun usually refer to him by either the male or the female pronoun; the choice of either is often a source of much contention.</span><br/>(Source: Wikipedia)",

He is part of the school's kyÅ«dÅ� club and often participates (and tops) school competitions. Also because of his cool and calm composure he is very popular with the girls.<br/><br/>He lives in a shrine owned by his late grandfather, a priest in which during his childhood told him a lot of stories about folklore and shinto practices. However, despite his heritage, Doumeki has a nearly null ability of seeing ghosts or spirits, though he can still exorcise them. He does seem to be able to feel spiritual \"pressure\" and have a vague sense of their presence. One spirit he did see was the Lady in the Park that Watanuki often visited.<br/><br/>Doumeki has a pure or refreshing scent as noted by the Ame-Warashi. Kohane noted that Doumeki was a 'beautiful' or 'pretty' person, most likely referring to his spirit or aura. Naturally, Watanuki is bewildered (and rather agitated) by this. Doumeki cannot enter Yuuko's Store, the explanation why is later revealed on volume 8. His technique of exorcising spirits is by shooting them with an invisible arrow made of pure energy, as first revealed in volume 2.<br/><br/><span class=\"spoiler\">Originally Doumeki could not see the spirits/ghosts that Watanuki could see (like that of the oden shop owner and the Ghost Girl who haunted a scary home) but after he shared both his blood and half his eye with Watanuki he was able to eventually see and experience what Watanuki goes through.</span><br/>Doumeki's personality is a total opposite of Watanuki's. He has a cool, calm and often sarcastic demeanor. He barely speaks unless explaining folklore or asking Watanuki for impossible bento lunches (such as asking for food that is out of season or hard to find). He also has a deadpan sense of humor that is often dark and somewhat fatalistic. Much to the annoyance of Watanuki he seems to pop up everywhere, especially when Watanuki gets a chance to be with Himawari. He often replies in a one word phrase like \"Hn\" or \"Oh\". He is also very observant, and even though he does not show it he seems to be very protective of Watanuki, such as in Volume 5 where he stood for hours in the rain to make sure Watanuki was safe and in Volume 6 during the incident with the spirit in the park. Volume 9 of the manga through Doumeki's New Years dream we find out he looks like his late grandfather Haruka. His grandfather also knows more about Doumeki's past, and bears an uncanny resemblance to his grandson (though Watanuki points out that Haruka smiles much more).<br/><br/>(Source: CCS Wikia)",
