The purpose of this test is to check your code and your style as a developer. There are no catches, no tricks, just a normal exercise as it would be in a normal daily work. 

The project is quite simple. People want to search Anime characters easily and get related information. Using the https://kitsu.docs.apiary.io/# API I have a few tasks for you.

 This test has to be done using React.Js

**KIT-001 As a user I would like to see an alphabetically sorted list of Anime Characters**

         I would like to open a browser and see a list of Anime Characters sorted alphabetically. The list must contain the ID, Name, Type, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, and Role

**KIT-002 As a user I would like to see an alphabetically sorted list of Manga Characters**

         I would like to open a browser and see a list of Manga Characters sorted alphabetically. The list must contain the ID, Name, Type, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, and Role

**KIT-003 As a user I would like to search a name on the list of Manga Characters**

       I would like to have a search box where I can type the Name of a character and update the list with the data of that single Manga Characters

**KIT-004 As a user I would like to search a name on the list of Anime Characters**
    
       I would like to have a search box where I can type the Name of a character and update the list with the data of that single Anime Character
